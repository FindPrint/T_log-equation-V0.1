# Spatio-Temporal Validation Suite (Blocks 7–14)

This section consolidates all validation tests performed on the enriched spatio-temporal model (d=4).  
It demonstrates that the system is universally critical, invariant across time, space, scale, and robust to noise.

## Block 7 — Enriched Dimension (d=4) + Sensitivity
- At d=4, T_log = 0 → **Equilibrium**.
- Sensitivity: d=3.9 → Divergence; d=4.1 → Saturation.
- Confirms d=4 is the exact critical boundary.

## Block 8 — Temporal Stability
- Decade 2000s: Equilibrium
- Decade 2010s: Equilibrium
- Decade 2020s: Equilibrium
- **Conclusion:** Equilibrium persists across decades.

## Block 9 — Spatial Stability
- Quadrants NE, NW, SE, SW: all Equilibrium.
- **Conclusion:** Equilibrium invariant across geography.

## Block 10 — Combined Temporal × Spatial Stability
- Each decade × quadrant subgroup (even with n≈25) → Equilibrium.
- **Conclusion:** Criticality is universal and scale-invariant.

## Block 11 — Multi-Scale Stress Test
- Random subsamples (n=20 → 700) all yield Equilibrium.
- **Conclusion:** Equilibrium is invariant to sample size.

## Block 12 — Noise Robustness on n
- Perturbations of n (±1% → ±20%) → always Equilibrium.
- **Conclusion:** Stable against counting noise.

## Block 13 — Noise Sensitivity on d
- Perturbations of d (±0.01 → ±0.20):
  - d < 4 → Divergence
  - d > 4 → Saturation
- **Conclusion:** d=4 is a knife-edge critical point, hypersensitive to dimensional shifts.

## Block 14 — Memory Kernel Perturbation
- Exponential and boxcar kernels alter effective counts n_eff.
- At d=4, T_log ≡ 0 regardless of n_eff.
- **Conclusion:** Memory reshapes dynamics but does not move the critical boundary.

## Final Statement
Across all spatio-temporal validations (Blocks 7–14), the enriched model demonstrates:
- **Universal Equilibrium at d=4**
- **Temporal and spatial invariance**
- **Scale invariance across subsamples**
- **Robustness to noise in n**
- **Hypersensitivity to perturbations in d**
- **Neutrality under memory kernels**

This confirms that the enriched T_log model captures a **self-organized critical system**:  
robust at the macroscopic level, yet finely balanced at the microscopic dimension.
